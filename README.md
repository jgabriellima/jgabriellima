# João Gabriel Lima

I work on enterprise AI systems, with an emphasis on architecture, agentic systems, and governance. My focus is on designing AI solutions that can grow, adapt, and remain reliable over time.

## What I work on

- **Agentic Systems Architecture**
  Designing multi-agent systems with clear responsibilities, control flows, and failure boundaries.

- **AI Evaluation & Optimization**
  Building evaluation layers that make agent behavior observable, comparable, and improvable.

- **Enterprise AI Governance**
  Translating governance frameworks (e.g. ISO 42001) into concrete architectural and operational decisions.

- **Production Readiness**
  Making AI systems deployable, auditable, and maintainable beyond the prototype stage.

## Selected Work & Experiments

This repository contains:
- architectural prototypes
- reference implementations
- experimental frameworks
- design notes and technical essays

Most projects are **intentionally incomplete**:
they exist to explore design space, trade-offs, and constraints — not to be products.

## Notes

I believe AI systems should be:
- engineered, not improvised
- governed, not just optimized
- understood, not mystified
